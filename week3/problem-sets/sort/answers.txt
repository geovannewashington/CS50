sort1 uses: 
Bubble Sort 

How do you know?: 
Because it was faster [O(n)] for a large file (sorted50000.txt) than sort2 [O(n log n)] for the same file
and it was roughly the sime time for the worst case as sort3 algorithm [O(n^2)] 

sort2 uses: 
Merge Sort 

How do you know?: 
Because it had little difference between the worst case (unsorted list) and best case (sorted list)
While being faster than sort3


sort3 uses: 
Selection Sort

How do you know?: 
Because it had little difference between the worst case (unsorted list) and best case (sorted list)
While being slower than sort2
