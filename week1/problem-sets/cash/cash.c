PS notes:
$1.00 == 100cents
user input == change owned (nice, we won't need to calculate it)
Core of problem: NOTE: prints the minimum coins needed to make the given amount of change, in cents

let user input = 70
output should be: 4 (25, 25, 10, 10)

Coins we have available: 
25cents, 10cents, 5cents, 1cent
